Welcome to the wonderful world of Python programming!

## Why Python?

Python is one of the most **beginner-friendly** programming languages because:

- ‚úÖ **Simple, readable syntax** - looks almost like English
- ‚úÖ **Versatile** - used for web development, data science, AI, and more
- ‚úÖ **Huge community** - tons of help and resources available
- ‚úÖ **Great career prospects** - high demand in the job market

## What we'll cover:

1. **Setting up Python** - Installation and your first "Hello World"
2. **Variables and Data Types** - Strings, numbers, booleans, and lists
3. **Input/Output** - Getting user input and displaying results
4. **Control Structures** - if/else statements and loops
5. **Functions** - Writing reusable code

## You'll need:

- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Python 3.x installed
- A text editor or IDE (we'll use IDLE or VS Code)

> üí° **Pro tip:** Don't just watch - code along! The best way to learn programming is by doing.
