## Creating Quiz Content

### Method 1: Using the Creator Tool (Recommended)

1. **Open `creator.html`** in your web browser
2. **Load a YouTube video** by pasting the URL and clicking "Load Video"
3. **Add video information** - title, description, and unique ID
4. **Create questions interactively:**
   - Watch the video and pause at desired timestamps
   - Click "Add Question At [timestamp]" to create questions
   - Use the rich text editor for question content
   - Choose from multiple question types with guided forms
   - Add helpful hints for each question
5. **Manage your questions** - edit, delete, or reorder in the questions panel
6. **Export your quiz** - click "Export" to generate the JSON data
7. **Integrate with main app** - copy the exported data into your `videos.js` file

### Method 2: Manual Editing

### 1. Edit videos.js
Add new video entries to the `videoDatabase` object:

```javascript
"your-video-id": {
    id: "your-video-id",
    title: "Your Video Title",
    videoId: "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID",  // From YouTube URL
    description: "Brief description of the video content",
    questions: [
        // Add your questions here using the formats above
    ]
}
```

### 2. Get YouTube Video ID
From a YouTube URL like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123XYZ`, the video ID is `ABC123XYZ`.

### 3. Define Questions
- Use `time` property for when questions appear (in seconds)
- Include helpful `hint` text for better learning experience
