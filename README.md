```javascript
{
    time: 30,
    type: "multiple_choice",
    question: "What is JavaScript primarily used for?",
    options: ["Web development", "Database management", "Operating systems"],
    correct: 0,  // Index of correct answer
    hint: "Think about what runs in web browsers..."
}
```

### Free Form Questions
```javascript

    answer: "let",  // Accepts partial matches
    hint: "Introduced in ES6, preferred over 'var'..."
}
```

## Adding New Videos

### 1. Edit videos.js
Add new video entries to the `videoDatabase` object:

```javascript
"your-video-id": {
    id: "your-video-id",
    title: "Your Video Title",
    videoId: "YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID",  // From YouTube URL
    description: "Brief description of the video content",
    questions: [
        // Add your questions here using the formats above
    ]
}
```

### 2. Get YouTube Video ID
From a YouTube URL like `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABC123XYZ`, the video ID is `ABC123XYZ`.

### 3. Define Questions
- Use `time` property for when questions appear (in seconds)
- Include helpful `hint` text for better learning experience
- Test thoroughly to ensure proper timing

## Customization Options

### Styling
The application uses embedded CSS that can be modified in `index.html`:
- **Color schemes** - Update CSS custom properties
- **Layout adjustments** - Modify flexbox and grid layouts
- **Question styling** - Customize `.drag-item`, `.drop-zone`, etc.

### Behavior Settings
Key variables in the JavaScript section:
```javascript
const maxAttempts = 3;  // Maximum attempts per question
// Modify other constants as needed
```

### Question Timing
- Questions pause video automatically
- Users must answer to continue
- Timeline shows visual markers for all questions
